# Installing the Prisma VPN on Linux
This is a short how-to for people on Linux at the University of Nebraska Omaha to install the Prisma VPN.

# Method 1: Script Install
Run this command: wget https://github.com/UNO-IST-Support/installPrismaVPNLinux-UNO/blob/main/installVPN.sh
<br/>
Once the file has downloaded, run the script: ./installVPN.sh
<br/>
This should install the dependencies and the VPN. This will also give you the command to launch the UI after it is installed.
